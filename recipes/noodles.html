    <li>1.5 tablespoons (12g) gochugaru</li>
    <li>1.5 teaspoons crushed (7g) red pepper</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon(17g) chinese black vinegar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon (3g) MSG </li>
    <li>2 teaspoon (10g) sesame seeds, lightly ground</li>
    <li>1/3 cup (75g) vegetable oil </li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Make The Noodles</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Add water to a large sauce pot and bring it to a boil.</li>
    <li>Put the potatoes into the pot, and cook the potatoes until tender.</li>
    <li>Mash the potatoes as finely as possible with a potato ricer.</li>
    <li>Mix corn starch, potato starch, and room temperature water together until combined and work the dough until it is smooth, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>With a knife, divide into 16 pieces, roll each piece into 6 inch long pieces.</li>
    <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil, and add the noodles in. Be sure to be gentle as the noodles are delicate before they are cooked.</li>
    <li>When the noodles begin to float, notice the change in color and texture. They will swell, so be sure to stir the water to keep them from sticking.</li>
    <li>Test a noodle, by tasting it, once it is clear/opaque. When the noodles have finished cooking, strain and toss in sauce.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Make The Chili Garlic Sauce & Assemble</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a small sauce pot or saut√© pan, heat vegetable oil until it is very hot.</li>
    <li>Combine all ingredients except oil in a large heat proof bowl.</li>
    <li>Once the oil is hot, around 300-350 Fahrenheit. Pour your hot oil into that bowl and mix.</li>
    <li> Allow to sit for 5 minutes then toss in noodles to coat.</li>
</ol>
